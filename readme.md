USB is great - endless 5V power supplies to be used on many projects. As a result, I design a lot of things with it, and you might as well.

While there are many USB power meters to show current/voltage information, I wanted a way to use the current-limiting features of my power supply when I first plug in a design so nothing goes boom. Assuming that's the case, I can then also see what sort of current draw the device has.

The banana spacing is adjustable as well since it would appear the standard for banana plugs is not a standard in some cases. There is a spot for either through-hole or SMT resistors across data lines if your device is smart enough to check for that.
